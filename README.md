black jack, this is a game is close to my heart as this is one of the first card games i learned as a child. gorwing up in a filipino house hold we were big on playing cards at family get together. It was also a great way to learn quick math as a child. 

concept of the game is to obtain 21 
whether that be a 
Ace and a face card or Ace and a 10.
